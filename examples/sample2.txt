# Vector Space Model

The vector space model (VSM) is an algebraic model for representing text documents as vectors of identifiers, such as index terms. It is used in information filtering, information retrieval, indexing and relevancy rankings.

In the vector space model, documents and queries are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a separate term. If a term occurs in the document, its value in the vector is non-zero.

Several different ways of computing these values, also known as term weights, have been developed. One of the best known schemes is tf-idf weighting (term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency).
